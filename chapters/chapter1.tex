\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation and Context}
Modern physics faces profound challenges, including the unexplained nature of dark matter and dark energy, as well as the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics.

\section{Emergent Spacetime Quantum-Entanglement Theory (ESQET)}
ESQET proposes that spacetime and gravity emerge from a dimensionless \emph{Spacetime Information Field} \(\mathcal{S}\), modulated by the Quantum Coherence Function \(\mathcal{F}_{QC}\):
\[
\Box \mathcal{S} = \left( G_0 \cdot \frac{G}{c^2} \right) \cdot \left( \rho_M + \frac{\mathcal{E}_{EM}}{c^2} + \rho_{DM} + \rho_{DE} \right) \cdot \mathcal{F}_{QC}
\]

\section{Research Objectives}
This research aims to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Develop a rigorous mathematical framework.
\item Provide computational realizations.
\item Explore applications and experimental tests.
\end{itemize}
