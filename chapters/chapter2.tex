Chapter 2: Mathematical Framework: The ESQET Field Equations ​2.1 The Unified ESQET Field Equation (v3.1) ​The core of ESQET is the generalized field equation governing the dynamics of the Spacetime Information Field (\mathbf{\mathcal{S}}). This equation is an extension of the classical wave equation, incorporating General Relativity (via G_{\text{Newton}}), vacuum energy, dark sector components, and the Quantum Coherence Function (\mathcal{F}_{\text{QC}}). ​The master ESQET Field Equation (v3.1) is:
\left( \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \right) \mathcal{S} = \left( G_0 \cdot \frac{G_{\text{Newton}}}{c^2} \right) \cdot \left( \sum \rho_{\text{mass/energy}} \right) \cdot \mathcal{F}_{\text{QC}}(\text{scale}, \mathcal{D}_{\text{ent}}, \mathcal{O})Where the generalized source term, \sum \rho_{\text{mass/energy}}, is the total informational density of the universe (including all dark components), and \mathcal{F}_{\text{QC}} is the core coherence modulator. The source term must include the informational densities required for extreme applications, such as \rho_{\text{temp}} (temporal density). ​2.2 The Master Quantum Coherence Function (\mathcal{F}_{\text{QC}}) ​The operational heart of ESQET is the \mathcal{F}_{\text{QC}}, which governs how informational coherence modulates the \mathcal{S} field. It is comprised of three primary components: the Observational Structured Energy Bracket, the Application Modulation Bracket, and the Quantum Phase Modulation Bracket. ​2.2.1 Master Coherence Function Structure ​The unified \mathcal{F}_{\text{QC}} (v3.1) is defined as:
