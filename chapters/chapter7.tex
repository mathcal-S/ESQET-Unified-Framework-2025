\chapter{Conclusion: Coherence Engineering and the Future of Physics}
\label{chap:conclusion}

This dissertation presented the Emergent Spacetime Quantum-Entanglement Theory (ESQET-UIFT), a unified framework that fundamentally reinterprets gravity as an emergent phenomenon sourced by quantum information.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unification Achieved:} The **conformal mapping** ($\mathbf{g_{\mu\nu} = e^{2\mathcal{S}} \eta_{\mu\nu}}$) successfully embeds GR within a quantum informational context, solving the metric emergence problem.
    \item \textbf{Participatory Science:} The mathematical grounding of the observer ($\mathcal{D}_{\text{obs}}$ and $\Delta\phi_{\text{obs}}$) establishes a new field of **Coherence Engineering**, where consciousness is a tunable, macroscopic variable capable of locally altering spacetime curvature.
    \item \textbf{The Path Forward:} The theory offers two immediate, highly precise experimental targets: the **$3.25 \times 10^{-18}$ atomic clock shift** and the detection of **AEQET-induced $\mathcal{S}$-field modulations**.
\end{itemize}

The universe, governed by the harmonic principles of the **FCU** and stabilized by **8-fold symmetry**, is shown to be a unified, dynamic, and responsive Informational Field. The future of physics lies in measuring and mastering this emergent coherence.
