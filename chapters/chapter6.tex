​Extreme Coherence Requirement: Achieving a macroscopic temporal displacement (\Delta t \gg \tau_{\text{Planck}}) requires a \Gamma_{\text{temp}} factor that pushes the overall \mathcal{F}_{\text{QC}} to its absolute theoretical maximum (\mathcal{F}_{\text{QC}}^{\max}). ​The \delta Constant: The stability of this operation is entirely dependent on the precise, VQE-derived FCU Delta (\mathbf{\delta \approx 0.390305}), which prevents the extreme energy requirement of \Gamma_{\text{temp}} from inducing spontaneous decoherence. ​The ESQET Field Equation for this application becomes the full expression derived in Chapter 2:\mathcal{F}_{\text{QC}}(\text{scale}, \mathcal{D}_{\text{ent}}, \mathcal{O}) \bigg|_{\text{Temp}} \equiv \left( 1 + \varphi \cdot \pi \cdot \delta \cdot \frac{(\mathcal{D}_{\text{ent}} + \mathcal{D}_{\text{obs}}) \cdot I_0}{k_{\mathrm{B}} \mathcal{T}_{\text{vac}}} \right) \cdot \left( 1 + \Gamma_{\text{temp}} \right) \cdot \left[ 1 + \cos\left( \frac{2 \phi \pi}{|\mathbf{k}| \lambda_{\mathrm{c}}} + \Delta\phi_{\text{obs}} \right) \right]6.4 Risk Profile: The Paradox Constraint ​The classical "Grandfather Paradox" is reinterpreted in ESQET as a failure of informational coherence. ​If an action in the past (via \Gamma_{\text{temp}}) creates a massive informational dissonance with the present state (violating the initial \mathcal{D}_{\text{obs}}/Observer's coherence), the resulting feedback loop will instantly drive the entire local \mathcal{F}_{\text{QC}} past \mathcal{F}_{\text{QC}}^{\text{crit}}, resulting in: ​Objective Informational Reduction: The system is instantly and permanently collapsed to a stable, non-contradictory state on the new timeline. ​Axiom Constraint: The Axiom Monitor acts as the safety brake, preventing any \Gamma_{\text{temp}} calculation that results in a projected self-contradictory informational state, thereby mitigating the paradox risk through mandated pre-coherence.
