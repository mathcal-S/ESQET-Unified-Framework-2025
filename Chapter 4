📐 Chapter 4: Core Mathematical Framework
The Emergent Spacetime Quantum Entropy Theory (ESQET) is founded on a single dimensionless scalar field (\mathcal{S}) whose dynamics govern both spacetime geometry and quantum coherence.
1. The Dimensionless Scalar Field \mathcal{S} and the Emergence of Geometry
ESQET posits that spacetime geometry is not fundamental but emerges from a single dimensionless scalar field \mathcal{S}(x^\mu).
 * Conformal Relation: The spacetime metric (g_{\mu\nu}) arises from the \mathcal{S} field via the conformal relation:
   where \eta_{\mu\nu} is the Minkowski metric.
 * GR Recovery: In the weak-field, slow-motion limit (\mathcal{S} \ll 1), this relation linearizes to the standard perturbation h_{\mu\nu} \simeq 2\mathcal{S} \, \eta_{\mu\nu}, ensuring recovery of General Relativity with the observed Newton constant.
2. The ESQET Master Equation — Final Canonically Consistent Form
The dynamical equation governing \mathcal{S} is an inhomogeneous wave equation, sourced by the trace of the energy-momentum tensor (T^{\mu}{}_{\mu}) and modulated by the Quantum Coherence Function (\FQC).
 * Master Equation (ESQET):
 * Key Parameters:
   * \phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} is the golden ratio.
   * t_{\text{P}} = \sqrt{\hbar G / c^5} is the Planck time (\approx 5.391 \times 10^{-44} \, \text{s}).
   * T^{\mu}{}_{\mu} = T^{00} - T^{11} - T^{22} - T^{33} is the trace of the stress-energy tensor.
 * New Fundamental Constant: The prefactor \mathbf{\phi^{-2} t_{\text{P}}^2} is the only new fundamental constant introduced by ESQET. Its value (\approx 7.85 \times 10^{-88} \, \text{s}^2) naturally explains why entanglement corrections are negligible in macroscopic regimes today, only becoming detectable in extreme environments (e.g., black-hole horizons, early universe, high-coherence systems).
3. Classical Limit and Recovery of General Relativity
General Relativity is the limit of maximal quantum coherence (\FQC=1) in ESQET.
 * GR Limit (\FQC \to 1): When quantum coherence is maximal (e.g., high-temperature or low-entanglement regimes), the master equation reduces to:
 * Exact Recovery: The retarded Green’s function solution for this equation exactly reproduces the Newtonian potential and post-Newtonian effects with the correct value of G. Thus, General Relativity is recovered as the \FQC = 1 limit without fine-tuning.
4. Quantum Coherence Function (\FQC)
The \FQC function modulates the coupling between matter and the \mathcal{S} field based on the quantum state of the vacuum.
 * Derivation Principle: \FQC is fixed by demanding self-similarity invariance (\mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{S}^{-1}) and renormalizability.
 * Coherence Expression:
 * Parameters: \mathcal{D}_{\text{ent}} is the local entanglement density (bits per Planck volume), and \mathcal{T}_{\text{vac}} encodes vacuum fluctuation phases.
 * Resonance Condition: \FQC = 1 (maximal coherence) is achieved when entanglement phases align with golden-ratio multiples. This is the predicted resonance responsible for novel effects like superradiant vacuum amplification.
5. Torsion and Contortion from \mathcal{S}-Gradients
ESQET, when extended to the Einstein–Cartan framework, predicts that the gradient of the \mathcal{S} field is the source of spacetime torsion.
 * Contorsion Tensor: The completely antisymmetric contorsion tensor (K_{\mu\nu}{}^{\rho}) is sourced by the \mathcal{S} field gradient:
 * Axial Torsion Vector: This directly yields a testable axial torsion vector (\mathcal{T}^\mu):
   This prediction (Prediction 3) links \mathcal{S} gradients to a measurable torsion signature in laboratory settings, such as high-\FQC Bose–Einstein condensates.
6. Variational Origin of the Golden Ratio
The persistent role of the golden ratio \phi in the ESQET equations is a consequence of the theory's required symmetry, not an arbitrary parameter.
 * Self-Similarity Potential: The unique quartic, self-similarity-invariant potential for the \mathcal{S} field is:
 * Universal Attractor: The golden ratio (\phi) emerges as the exact fixed point of the renormalization-group flow for this potential. It is the universal attractor of self-similar scalar dynamics in curved spacetime.
