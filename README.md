# ESQET-Unified-Framework-2025# The Emergent Spacetime Quantum-Coherence Theory (ESQET)

A theoretical framework for a unified theory of everything, positing that gravity and spacetime dynamics are modulated by quantum coherence. This repository contains the source files for the dissertation submitted by Marco Rocha in 2025.

## üåü Introduction

The Emergent Spacetime Quantum-Coherence Theory (ESQET) proposes a novel extension to general relativity, where gravity emerges from a Spacetime Information Field ($\mathcal{S}$), dynamically modulated by a Quantum Coherence Function ($\mathcal{F}_{QC}$). This framework is a bold attempt to bridge the divide between quantum mechanics and general relativity, suggesting that the geometry of spacetime is intrinsically linked to the quantum-coherent state and informational organization of the universe.

This project introduces **"Golden Gravity,"** a core principle asserting that fundamental mathematical constants, specifically the Golden Ratio ($\phi$) and Pi ($\pi$), are woven into the very fabric of spacetime's efficiency in information organization. This is quantified by the **Fibonacci Coherence Unit (FCU)**, a key dimensionless coupling constant within the theory.

## üöÄ Key Hypotheses

* **Spacetime as a Scalar Information Field ($\mathcal{S}$):** Spacetime is not a passive backdrop but an active, dynamic information field whose perturbations correspond to gravity.
* **The Quantum Coherence Function ($\mathcal{F}_{QC}$):** A dynamic multiplier that amplifies or attenuates gravitational effects based on a system's quantum state, including entanglement density and vacuum energy.
* **The Fibonacci Coherence Unit (FCU):** A dimensionless term $(\phi \cdot \pi \cdot \frac{\Delta p}{L_{coh}})$ within the $\mathcal{F}_{QC}$ that suggests spacetime coherence is optimized when quantum parameters align with specific Golden Ratio-based harmonies.
* **Testable Predictions:** The theory makes concrete predictions, such as anomalous gravitational effects in regions of high quantum entanglement and a direct correlation between dark matter distribution and spacetime coherence anomalies.

## üìê Mathematical Framework

The core of the theory is expressed in two fundamental equations:

### 1. The ESQET Field Equation v3.0

This equation extends the wave equation for spacetime dynamics, showing its dependence on mass-energy and the quantum coherence function.

$$
\left( \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \right) \mathcal{S} = \left( \mathcal{G}_0 \cdot \frac{G}{c^2} \right) \cdot \left( \rho_M + \frac{E_{EM}}{c^2} + \dots \right) \cdot \mathcal{F}_{QC}
$$

### 2. The Quantum Coherence Function ($\mathcal{F}_{QC}$) v3.0

This dimensionless function quantifies the degree of spacetime coherence, incorporating the FCU and other key parameters.

$$
\mathcal{F}_{QC} = \left( 1 + \left( \phi \cdot \pi \cdot \frac{\Delta p}{L_{coh}} \right) \cdot \frac{\mathcal{D}_{ent} \cdot I_0}{k_B T_{vac}} \right) \cdot \left( 1 + \alpha_{dark} \cdot \frac{\rho_{DM} + \rho_{DE}}{\rho_{total}} \right)
$$
