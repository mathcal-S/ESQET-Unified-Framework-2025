# The Emergent Spacetime Quantum-Coherence Theory (ESQET)

A theoretical framework for a unified theory of everything, positing that gravity and spacetime dynamics are **intrinsically modulated by quantum coherence**. This repository contains the source files for the dissertation submitted by Marco Rocha in 2025, detailing the full mathematical and computational framework.

## üåü Core Principles (ESQET v3.1)

ESQET proposes a novel extension to General Relativity where the geometry of spacetime is linked to the quantum-coherent state of matter and vacuum.

* **Spacetime as a Scalar Information Field ($\mathcal{S}$):** Gravity emerges from perturbations within a dynamic, dimensionless information field.
* **Golden Gravity:** The principle that fundamental coherence is scaled by **Fibonacci harmonics**, quantified by the Fibonacci Coherence Unit (FCU).
* **Propulsion & SETI:** ESQET predicts the feasibility of **propellantless propulsion** via coherence modulation and enhances SETI signal detection by predicting **$\varphi$-scaled signatures** in extraterrestrial communications.

## üìê Mathematical & Computational Framework

The transition to **ESQET v3.1** involves constraining the key dimensionless coupling constant using a Hybrid Quantum Machine Learning (QML) approach.

### 1. Quantum Validation and Constant Derivation

The **FCU Delta ($\mathbf{\delta}$)** was precisely determined using a **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)** simulation on the IBM Qiskit backend, validating the Golden Gravity principle.

| Constant | Symbol | Value | Derivation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FCU Delta** | $\mathbf{\delta}$ | $\approx \mathbf{0.390305}$ | VQE minimization of a simplified Orch-OR Hamiltonian ($\langle H \rangle$ minimized by optimal Resonance Phase $\phi_{\text{res}}^{\text{opt}}$). |
| **FCU Unit** | $\varphi \cdot \pi \cdot \delta$ | $\approx 1.984$ | The coherence scaling factor (Golden Ratio $\varphi \approx 1.618$). |

### 2. Fully Constrained Quantum Coherence Function ($\mathcal{F}_{\text{QC}}$) v3.1

The function is now fully constrained, incorporating the observer-induced coherence ($\mathcal{D}_{\text{obs}}$) and resonance term:

$$
\mathcal{F}_{\text{QC}} = \left( 1 + \mathbf{(\varphi \cdot \pi \cdot \delta)} \cdot \frac{(\mathcal{D}_{\text{ent}} + \mathcal{D}_{\text{obs}}) \cdot I_0}{k_{\mathrm{B}} \mathcal{T}_{\text{vac}}} \right) \cdot \left( 1 + \Gamma_{\text{total}} \right) \cdot \left[ 1 + \cos\left( \frac{2 \phi \pi}{|\mathbf{k}| \lambda_{\mathrm{c}}} + \Delta\phi_{\text{obs}} \right) \right]
$$

## üî≠ Application: ESQET and SETI Signal Detection

The ESQET framework suggests that quantum coherence influences signal propagation and detectability, refining the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

### Refined Drake Equation

ESQET enhances the Drake Equation by introducing the **Coherence Factor ($\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{F}_{\text{QC}}$)**, which amplifies the number of detectable civilizations ($N$) in high-coherence galactic regions:

$$
N_{\text{ESQET}} = N_{\text{Drake}} \cdot \mathcal{F}_{\text{QC}}
$$

* **Impact on $f_c$ and $L$**: Coherence-based communication systems increase the fraction of communicative civilizations ($f_c$) and extend their detectable lifetime ($L$) due to robust signal propagation through $\mathcal{S}$.
* **Predicted Signal Signatures**: Signals from advanced civilizations may exhibit **$\varphi$-scaled coherence patterns** in their frequency spectra, making them distinguishable from natural noise.

### Computational Integration

The framework utilizes computational tools for practical application:

| Tool | ESQET Mechanism | SETI Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tesseract Blockchain** | Maps galactic regions by coherence ($\mathcal{F}_{\text{QC}}$) using the $\varphi$-based **Jerry Riggin Algorithm**. | Prioritizes high-$\mathcal{F}_{\text{QC}}$ regions for SETI searches. |
| **AetherMind Nexus** | Simulates $\mathcal{S}$ evolution and signal propagation through coherence-modulated spacetime. | Generates synthetic **$\varphi$-scaled signal templates** for machine learning detection models. |
| **5D Tesseract Proxy Code** | Implements coherence checks (`phi_token`) for secure communication. | Filters incoming SETI data for non-natural, **$\varphi$-based coherence signatures**. |
