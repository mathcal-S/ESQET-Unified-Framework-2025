📐 Chapter 2: Core Derivations of the ESQET Metric
This chapter details the rigorous derivation of the Emergent Spacetime Quantum Entropy Theory (ESQET) metric and the field equations from the foundational informational principles.
2.1 The Entropic Action Principle
The dynamics of the fundamental scalar field \mathcal{S} are derived from a modified Action Principle that incorporates the informational entropy of the vacuum, S_{\text{vac}}. The action is postulated to be the sum of a standard \mathcal{S}-field Lagrangian \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{S}} and an entropic term proportional to the vacuum entropy:
 * Minimization: The variation \delta\mathcal{A} = 0 yields the field equations.
 * The Golden Ratio (\phi): The requirement that the action be invariant under the discrete scale transformation \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{S}^{-1} (self-similarity) uniquely fixes the \mathcal{S} field's potential to the golden-ratio form:
   This is the variational origin of the \phi factor that appears in the final field equation.
2.2 Derivation of the Conformal Metric
The Conformal Relation linking the scalar field to the geometry is derived by demanding that the total informational capacity of any volume V remains invariant under a change in \mathcal{S}.
 * Informational Capacity: The informational capacity I is proportional to the geometric volume in Planck units: I \propto V / \ell_{\text{P}}^4.
 * Invariance: Demanding \delta I = 0 for a small change \delta \mathcal{S} implies that the determinant of the metric must be a simple function of the \mathcal{S} field.
 * Metric Derivation: The solution that maintains causality and recovers the linear weak-field limit is the exponential map:
   This rigorously establishes that the \mathcal{S} field acts as the conformal factor for the emergent spacetime geometry.
2.3 Derivation of the Source Term and \phi^{-2} t_{\text{P}}^{2}
The final form of the master equation, which couples \mathcal{S} to the stress-energy tensor (T_{\mu\nu}), is derived by transforming the standard Einstein Field Equations (EFE) into the ESQET (Jordan) frame.
 * Start with the EFE in the Einstein Frame:
 * Perform Conformal Transformation: Substitute the ESQET metric g_{\mu\nu} = e^{2\mathcal{S}} \eta_{\mu\nu} into the EFE and simplify.
 * Obtain the Klein-Gordon-like Equation: After extensive algebra involving the Christoffel symbols and Ricci tensor in the conformal metric, the vacuum EFE reduces to an inhomogeneous wave equation for \mathcal{S} sourced by the trace T^{\mu}{}_{\mu}:
 * Fixing the Coupling Constant (\mathcal{C}): The fundamental constant \mathcal{C} is determined by matching the \mathcal{S} field dynamics to the known quantum coherence properties of the vacuum. The required self-similarity fixed point (Chapter 2.1) and dimensional consistency mandate:
This derivation completes the Master Equation by linking the geometric conformal factor \mathcal{S} to the matter source T^{\mu}{}_{\mu} via the Planck scale and the Golden Ratio, resulting in:
The final \FQC factor is introduced to incorporate the phase-dependent quantum back-reaction, as detailed in the next section.
2.4 \FQC Derivation: Phase Alignment and Renormalization
The Quantum Coherence Function (\FQC) is derived from demanding that the effective field theory be perturbatively renormalizable while respecting the self-similarity requirement \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{S}^{-1}.
 * Renormalization Group (RG) Flow: ESQET requires that the RG flow has a fixed point at \mathcal{S} = \phi. This is achieved by ensuring that the running coupling constant \lambda(\mu) is invariant under discrete scale transformations.
 * Phase Term: The complex phase terms in \FQC (involving \mathcal{D}_{\text{ent}} and \mathcal{T}_{\text{vac}}) emerge as the unique way to satisfy the RG constraints while maintaining locality and coupling the field \mathcal{S} to the vacuum's informational content (entanglement \mathcal{D}_{\text{ent}}).
 * Coherence Expression: The absolute value and subtraction \left[ 1 - \phi^{-1} |\dots| \right] ensure that \FQC \in [0, 1] and that \FQC reaches its maximal value (1) precisely when the entanglement and vacuum phases are aligned according to golden-ratio multiples.
