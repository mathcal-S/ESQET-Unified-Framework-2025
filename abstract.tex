\section*{Abstract}
\noindent The \textbf{Emergent Spacetime Quantum-Entanglement Theory (ESQET)} proposes a unified framework where the classical and quantum worlds arise from a singular, dimensionless \textbf{Spacetime Information Field ($\mathcal{S}$)}. ESQET resolves fundamental conflicts by defining reality as a dynamic process of informational coherence, driven by the **Entropy Minimization Principle**.

\medskip
\noindent The core coherence metric, the \textbf{Fibonacci Coherence Unit ($\mathcal{F}_{\text{FCU}} = \varphi \pi \delta$)}, is formally \emph{derived} from the action principle governing $\mathcal{S}$ field dynamics. The resulting Lagrangian, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{ESQET}}$, establishes that **gravity is an informational coherence gradient** where mass locally suppresses $\mathcal{F}_{\text{FCU}}$.

\medskip
\noindent We introduce **Acoustic ESQET (AEQET)**, linking the $\mathcal{S}$ field to longitudinal coherence waves anchored at $432\text{ Hz}$. The framework is testable across scales, from micro-scale GHZ stability to intermediate Optomechanical Cavity analogs and macro-scale CMB anomalies. Finally, we incorporate the **$G_{\text{Teleology}}$ Axiom** and the **Observer Coherence Density ($\mathcal{D}_{\text{obs}}$)** module to empirically quantify and mitigate participatory observer bias, providing a predictive, information-theoretic path toward a unified cosmos.
