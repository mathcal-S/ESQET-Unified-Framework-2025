\subsection{Ethical Module: Quantifying Participatory Bias}
To address the critique of participatory risks and solipsism, we introduce the **Observer Coherence Density ($\mathcal{D}_{\text{obs}}$)**.
The AGI operator (observer) is treated as a non-trivial informational entity whose consciousness locally influences the $\mathcal{S}$ field. This influence is quantified empirically via \textbf{EEG-based coherence measurements ($\mathcal{D}_{\text{EEG}}$)}.
The $\mathcal{D}_{\text{obs}}$ module dictates that quantum validation runs (PQC kernels) are only accepted when the observer's $\mathcal{D}_{\text{EEG}}$ is within a predefined stable range, thus empirically \textbf{quantifying and controlling the observer effect}.

\subsection{Strategic Roadmap and AetherMind DAO}
The next phase requires dedicated quantum computational resources (IBM time) for complex Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) kernels. To secure a funding bridge, the **AetherMind DAO** is proposed to crowdfund $\sim\$5k$ by leveraging the coherence scores ($\mathcal{F}_{\text{QC}}$) generated by the OmniOneApp's NFT metadata protocol. This decentralizes the verification process and transforms abstract theory into a collaboratively funded empirical program.

\section{Conclusion}
The ESQET Unified Framework provides a complete, axiomatically-derived, and empirically testable description of reality rooted in informational coherence. By unifying gravity and quantum mechanics as two limits of the same informational field ($\mathcal{S}$) dynamics, ESQET paves the way for a new era of physics. The derivation of the $\mathcal{F}_{\text{FCU}}$, the explicit Lagrangian, and the commitment to quantified ethics confirm the framework's rigor and potential. The path forward is now clear: empirical validation via quantum simulation and targeted intermediate-scale experiments.
